## ATtiny85 I2C Bootloader

Timonel is an I2C bootloader for ATtiny85/45/25 microcontrollers. The aim is to enable AVR firmware updates in scenarios where there is a more powerful MCU (ESP8266, Arduino, RPi, BeagleBone, etc.) acting as I2C master and one or more Tiny85 as I2C slave performing peripheral functions.

Some possible cases:

* A small robot controlled by Raspberry Pi where the specific functions of each limb are delegated to several Tiny85 through an I2C bus.
* Multi-sensor systems, where each Tiny85 is a node that handles one or more sensors.
* etc ...

In these situations, it's handy to be able to update the AVRs firmware straight from the I2C master. But, so far (mid-2018), I haven't found an I2C bootloader that fits directly the TinyX5 family, addressing its several limitations:

* It doesn't have dedicated hardware to handle I2C, only the USI (Universal Serial Interface).
* It lacks a protected memory area for the bootloader.
* It is not possible to redirect the interruption vectors to the bootloader.

That's why I started writing this one.

## Usage:

* [Install](/timonel-bootloader/README.md#Installation) "timonel.hex" on a Tiny85 (bare chips or Digisparks).
* Compile your [application program](/apps) and convert the generated ".hex" into an array of bytes to be included in "timonel-twim-ss" or "timonel-twim-ms" (e.g. uint8\_t payload[size] = { 0xaa, 0xbb, ...}; ). Use "[tml-hexparser](/timonel-hexparser)" for helping to create the array (payload).
* Use [VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) + [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org) to compile and install "[timonel-twim-ss.bin](/timonel-twim-ss)" or "[timonel-twim-ms.bin](/timonel-twim-ms)" (containing the payload) in an arduino-compatible MCU. It has been tested with ESP8266 ESP01 and NodeMCU. **Note:** the ".bin" file provided contains a small payload demo that sends an SOS by blinking PB1.
* Connect both chips by **I2C** (SDA, SCL and ground).
* Open an asynchronous terminal (e.g. [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net)) connected to the serial port of the I2C master (9600 N 8 1).
* Run the commands shown on screen for erasing and flashing new firmware on the Tiny85.
* It is also possible to update the bootloader itself by using "[timonel-updater](/timonel-updater)" (based on the micronucleus upgrade program).

## Version History:

**v1.4** \- 2019\-10\-29: Functional Release: Significant memory saving by inlining the TWI driver functions\, now the smaller version "tml\-t85\-small" occupies less than 1 kB\, leaving 7 kB available for user applications\. Speed improvement through a code tuning to transmit 32\-byte packets \(half a page of memory in a Tiny85\)\. User\-application "**autorun**" is now optional. Internal clock configuration support improved. [Interactive master](/timonel-twim-ss) test program improved with streamlined libs (see it [working](http://youtu.be/-7GOMToGvzI)). [Multi-slave master](/timonel-twim-ms) test program added (see it [working](http://youtu.be/PM9X1thrdOY)).

**v1.3** \- 2019\-06\-06: Functional Release: Bootloader inline functions \(smaller code\) and low fuse auto clock tweaking\.Â Support for 1\, 2\, 8 and 16 MHz clock speed in user\-application mode\. TWI master UploadApplication refactoring\, now supports both types of page address calculation and both modes of **APP\_USE\_TPL\_PG**. Several bug fixes.

**v1.2** \- 2019\-05\-15: Functional Release: "Good\-neighbor" behavior fixes data dump operation interferences among Timonel devices in multi\-device bus setups\. The TWI master functionality has been packed in a couple of Arduino libraries to ease the handling of the several configuration options\. Timonel\-master\-ss firmware shows its usage\. The TWI master code was moved to PlatformIO\.

**v1.1** \- 2018\-10\-29: Functional Release: Optional ReadFlash command added\. Minor tweaks for running Timonel @ 8 MHz\.

**v1.0** \- 2018\-10\-05: Functional Release: Optional features implemented\.

**v0.9** \- 2018\-09\-29: Functional pre\-release: Temporary page buffer and other minor issues solved\.

**v0.8** \- 2018\-09\-16: First functional pre\-release\.

**v0.7** \- 2018\-09\-07: Non\-functional\.

**v0.4** \- 2018\-08\-10: Non\-functional\.
