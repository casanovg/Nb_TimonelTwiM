# Timonel TWI master - Multi slave

This ESP8266/Arduino test application [shows](https://youtu.be/PM9X1thrdOY) the usage of TWI master libraries.

It is a serial console-based application that runs a 3-time loop that flashes, deletes and runs a user application on three Tiny85's (two bare chips and a Digispark).

The application has been tested on ESP-01 and NodeMCU modules. It is compiled and flashed to the device using [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org) over [VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).
